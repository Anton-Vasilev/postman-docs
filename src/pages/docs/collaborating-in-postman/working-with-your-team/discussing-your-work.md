When there are new inline comments, an orange dot appears on the comments icon <img alt="Inline comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-inline-comment-v10-16.jpg#icon" width="22px"> in the request pane.

> To add a comment to a request, make sure to save the request first.

To add an inline comment to a request, do the following:

1. Open the request you want to comment on.
1. Switch to comment mode by selecting the comments icon <img alt="Comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-comments-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> in the request pane.

> If you have the Admin role for the workspace, you can delete comments made by any contributor, but you can't edit comments made by others.

## Replying to comments

You can reply to a comment to keep the conversation going. Replies are grouped with the original comment, so you can have more than one comment thread on a collection, folder, or request. When you reply to a comment, the person who added the comment will receive a notification about your reply.

To reply to a comment, do the following:

1. Select a collection, folder, or request in the sidebar, then select the comments icon <img alt="Comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-comments-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> in the right sidebar.
1. Select the comment you want to reply to and enter your reply.

    > If you select an inline comment, or open a link to an inline comment, Postman automatically switches to comment mode and opens the comment in context on the request.

1. (Optional) Select the **Watch collection** checkbox to be notified when there are changes to the collection.
1. Enter your reply and select **Reply**.

> You can't undo resolving a comment, but you can view resolved comments by selecting the filter icon <img alt="Filter icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-filter.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the comments pane.

## Mentioning teammates in comments

If you leave feedback or a question for a specific teammate, you can let them know by mentioning them in your comment. To mention a teammate in a comment, type `@` followed by their name, then choose the person from the auto-suggested list.

When you mention a teammate in a comment, Postman sends them a notification. Select the notifications icon <img alt="Notifications icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-notification-bell-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> in the Postman header to view in-app notifications.

> If your teammate doesn't have access to the collection they've been mentioned in, they'll need to [request access](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/) before they can read the comment.

## Using Markdown in comments

You can use Markdown in your comments. Check out the [Markdown Cheatsheet on GitHub](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for tips on formatting.
