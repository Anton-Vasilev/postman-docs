Postman can import and export Postman data, including collections, environments, globals, and data dumps. Postman can also import non-Postman data in the form of API definitions to help you consolidate your API development workflow.

* You can [import data into Postman](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/) by dragging and dropping files, or by pasting a cURL command, raw text, or a URL. Postman automatically recognizes Postman data such as collections, environments, and data dumps. You can also import API definitions into Postman.

* You can [import data from a Git repository](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-git/) so you can work with it in Postman. You can import collections, environments, and API definitions from local or remote GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps repositories.

* If you use New Relic to monitor your applications, you can [import data from New Relic](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-new-relic/) into a Postman Collection. The endpoints in each New Relic service are imported as requests in a collection.

* You can [export collections and environments](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) from Postman as JSON files. You can also [export a data dump](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#exporting-data-dumps) with all of your Postman collections, environments, globals, and header presets. After exporting, you can import the files into any Postman instance or use them with [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).
