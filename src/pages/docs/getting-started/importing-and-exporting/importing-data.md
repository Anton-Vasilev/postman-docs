You can import collections, API specifications, and data files directly into Postman.

To import your data into Postman, select **Import** in the upper left. The **Import** modal opens.

![Import data into Postman](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/import-export-import-ui-v10-17.jpg)

You can import your data from files, folders, links, raw text, or code repositories.

> You can also import items by dragging and dropping files or folders onto the sidebar.

    * [Converting Postman collections from v1 to v2](#converting-postman-collections-from-v1-to-v2)
* [Importing API definitions](#importing-api-definitions)

## Importing with cURL commands

You can use cURL commands to import data.

1. Select **Import** in the left navigation menu. The **Import** modal opens.
1. Paste your cURL command into the input field at the top. Postman creates and opens a request automatically.

    > You can also paste cURL commands into a request's URL field. For more information about working with cURL commands in Postman, read [Importing cURL commands](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-curl-commands/).

## Importing Postman data

You can import Postman data you exported earlier, including collections, environments, data dumps, and globals.

1. Select **Import** in the left navigation menu.
1. Do one of the following:
    * Select your file or folder, or drag it into the **Import** modal.
    * Paste your raw text or URL into the input field.
    * Select a button to import from [GitHub](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-git/#importing-from-github-repositories), [AWS API Gateway](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/#importing-api-definitions-from-amazon-api-gateway), or [New Relic](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-new-relic/).
    * Select **Other Sources** to import from a [Bitbucket](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-git/#importing-from-bitbucket-repositories), [GitLab](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-git/#importing-from-gitlab-repositories), or [Azure](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-git/#importing-from-azure-devops-repositories) code repository. You can also import an API from [Azure API Management](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/#importing-api-definitions-from-azure-api-management).

    Postman will automatically recognize Postman data, confirming the name, format, and type.

   ![Import collection and environment](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/import-elements-v10.jpg)

1. If you are importing multiple files, select the files you want to import and select **Import** to bring your data into Postman.

    > If you are importing a single file, Postman automatically imports it when you select it.

### Converting Postman collections from v1 to v2

Postman no longer supports the collection v1 format and will return an error if you import a collection in this format. You can convert your collection's format from v1 to v2 to import it into Postman.

To convert your collection's format from v1 to v2, do the following:

1. In the terminal of your choice, enter the following command to install the Postman Collection Transformer.

   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g postman-collection-transformer
   ```

1. Convert an individual Postman collection from v1 to v2 by entering this command:

   ```bash
   postman-collection-transformer convert -i <path to the input Postman Collection file> -o <path to the downloaded Postman file> -j 1.0.0 -p 2.0.0 -P
   ```

The resulting collection will download to your target file path in v2 format.

You can retrieve a list of convert options by running the command with the `-h` flag:

   ```bash
   postman-collection-transformer convert -h
   ```

See the [Postman Collection Transformer](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-collection-transformer) for more information on the collection conversion.

## Importing API definitions

To import your API definitions into Postman, see [Importing an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/).
