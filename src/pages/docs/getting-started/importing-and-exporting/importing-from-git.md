If you have collections, environments, or API definitions in a Git repository, you can import the data so you can work with it in Postman.

Postman supports importing from GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories. You can import data from a local or remote repository.

> You can also connect your API to a GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or Azure DevOps repository. Once connected, you can sync your API definition and associated collections in Postman with the remote repository. Learn more about [connecting your API to a Git repository](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/versioning-an-api-overview/).
