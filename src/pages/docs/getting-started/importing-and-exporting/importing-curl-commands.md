cURL is a popular command-line tool for making HTTP requests. When testing a web application or API, cURL enables you to interact directly from the command line, using a well-established syntax that's common in the API developer community. If you have several cURL commands in different places, you can import them into Postman.

* [Convert a Postman request to a cURL command](#convert-a-postman-request-to-curl)

## Import a cURL command into Postman

1. Select **Import** in the sidebar. The **Import** modal opens.
1. Paste your cURL command into the box at the top. Postman creates and opens a request automatically.

    > You can also paste cURL commands into a request's URL field.

## Convert a Postman request to cURL

To convert a Postman request to a cURL command, do the following:

1. Open the request you want to use for a code snippet, then select the code icon <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-code-snippet.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the right sidebar.

1. Select **cURL** from the dropdown list.
1. Select the copy icon <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-copy-v9.jpg#icon" width="15px"> to copy the code snippet to your clipboard.

    > If you prefer working inside the command line with cURL making basic requests, the [VS code extension](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-vs-code-extension/) is for you.
